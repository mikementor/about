Problem-solving approach [wip]

1. "I can't solve the task"
	1. How would describe the problem?
		1. I don't know, why am I doing anything
		2. I know what and how, but I just can't
		3. I don't know what to do
			1. ....
		4. I know, what to do, but I need **some externals**
			1. ....
		5. I know, what to do, but I don't know **how**
			1. How does the problem looks like?
				1. 'When I do __this__, it should be __that__, but there is __problem__ instead'
				2. What are steps to reproduce?
				3. What info can you see?[numbers, metrics, errors...]
				4. Does other similar/simpler cases work?
				5. How it would be look like without the __problem__?
				6. Can you point to the specific place of the problem?[service, class, function,...]
				7. Or Do you feel, like your model of the process is incomplete?
			2. **3-hour stuck rule**
				1. Stuck for 3 hour? Ask.
					1. "Hi,__name__! Could you help me with this __task_name_?"

### Step-by-step  first day at work


At the first day at work, the first question popping up is 'Where to start?'
Let's decompose it into:

1. What to do?
2. How to do?


# What to do?

To answer this question, you need to know:
1. What's the main goal?
2. What is already done?


### What's the main goal?
 - model  of some awesome product till some date.
 - - time constraints
 - - requirements

---
1. Create an Entrypoint
2. Create a testing strategy
3. Work!
---


Folder structure

- Entrypoint
- - Guides
