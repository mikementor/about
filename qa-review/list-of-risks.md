- Unclear understanding of the progress
    - [tools] Release notes
    - [tools] Sprint retrospectives
    - [tools] More fine-grained tasks
    - [tools] Maturity models
        - [tools] Test maturity models (TPI Next, TMMI, ...)
- Unstable deployment process
    - [tools] Deployment notes
- Long feedback loop
- Incorrect requirements
- Incorrect implementation of the requirements(Implementation doesn't match intention)
    - [tools] automation
    - [tools] breaking CI build on failed automated checks
- Unstable uptime of the service
    - [tools] [detection] Service monitoring  with health checks
- Incorrect cause of the problems investigation(When sympthom is fixed, not the root cause) 
    - [tools] Root cause analysis (RCA)
- Late delivery
    - [tools] Scope rework (dividing, including testing in estimates,....)
