#### Foundational and abstract

1. **Clarifying the model**

Problems are lying in the place of meaningful/purposeful reality representations. For example, product architecture / data flow / user journey. It's a shared between "should be / it is" search space because people usually somehow imagine a problem and  ways of solving it. In the absence of the problem and approaches to the solutions, asking a tester "what should we do? " would the same as asking a philosopher or prophet. 

Everything lies in intersections of tons of different models, and the degree of how neatly a tester swims between points of view from them should definitely be considered a skill.

Examples of models would be:
- user journey (the most obvious )
- architecture of the product and underlying supporting technologies(DB/services/HTTP(s)/DNS/TCP/etc)
- business domain
- standards
- people's  beliefs, biases, values...


> " I'm going to search for problems there "

2. **Risk realization**

(Or successful prioritization)

That's a skill of successfully investigating the right place on the model( from the (1) ) 

It's great if you flooded a task tracker with tons of issues, but if they don't resonate with the relevance of your teams' deployment, for example, you've found 146 inconsistencies with the design of the form, while leaving unchecked the fact, that the form doesn't work - well, you got the idea. (I leave aside the controversy about deep and shallow testing for a moment, but that's [the great talk from Michael Bolton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sPCyMxakY) )

> "I see an important problem *here* "

3. **Concerns Communication**

Effectively make use of your own work
- communicate with the relevant people about found concerns, so they made some informed decisions, such as:
- making better inputs for testers
- changing resource management (adding testers, e. g.) 
- changing the processes of (testing/development/deployment/etc) 

Basically, making a significant change thanks to the relevant information from the tester.

If the results of your actions don't change the behavior of anyone - probably, there's something wrong.

> "We should do something about that"

**Some hints**

Of there's no effective way to exercise all these skills on the workplace - it's probably better for a tester to leave.

If a tester isn't exercising all of these skills in a useful manner - it's probably better for the tester to leave.
