### Process - [todo]


The process  consists mainly of 3 parts:

1. Inputs
2. Action / Transformation (owner of the action?)
3. Outputs


### Inputs 

> In short: things necessary to make the action

### Action / Transformaiton

> In short: the transformation of inputs into outputs

1. Have  the owner of the action[`what` oк `who` performs]


### Outputs

> In short: process results.

>⚠️ To keep in mind: Outputs must be meaningfully consumed by other processes or be the end goals themselves.
Otherwise, the process just useless.
